        <p class="center">First and foremost, NERDZCrush is for users. We respect <strong>user privacy</strong> and
        we are <strong>completely transparent</strong>.</p>
        <p>NERDZCrush utilizes TLS with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">perfect forward secrecy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">Strict Transport Security</a>.
        See our security report at <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=media.nerdz.eu">Qualys SSL Labs</a>.</p>
        <p>For those of you who are even more privacy concious, we even have a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_hidden_service#Hidden_services">hidden service</a> from which you can upload files
        and share media. Check us out at <a href="http://mediacrs5ujufxog.onion/">http://mediacrs5ujufxog.onion/</a> to browse
        the site anonymously.</p>

    <div id="uploading" class="hidden">
        <p class="center">NERDZCrush supports nearly every <strong>image, audio, and video</strong> format ever made.</p>
        <ul id="types" class="inline">
            <li class="images">
                Images
            </li>

                Audio
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upload what you've got, and chances are it'll work great. You can even upload several of them to make an album!
        All images are hosted losslessly, and the original file is available for download for everything else. We have to
        convert files between formats for technical reasons, but if you ever notice a problem because of it,
        <a href="mailto:media@nerdz.eu">send us an email</a>.</p>
        <p>That conversion can be a good thing, though. Take GIFs, for example. Did you know that GIF files, while handy for
        sharing short animations, are really hard on bandwidth? We convert them to videos when you upload them, which reduces
        the file size quite a lot without making a noticable impact on quality. Bonus: you gain the ability to do things
        like pause them or change the playback speed.</p>
        <p>Here are some other cool features we support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subtitles</strong>: SSA, SRT, or VTT subtitled videos work great</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone</strong>: On the home page, click the microphone icon to upload directly from your mic</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="technical" class="hidden">
        <p class="center">This site is built with <strong>python, ffmpeg</strong>, and tons more open tech. There's a great
        public API, too.</p>
        <p>Want to hack on NERDZCrush from your own code?
        We've got a full-blown, free API that does everything you're hoping for. You can browse <a href="/docs">the
        documentation</a> to learn about each endpoint, find an API wrapper, and get directions for help.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you want to set up your own instance of NERDZCrush, on your own servers? You'll need to be a fairly
        experienced Linux sysadmin, but there are detailed instructions for you <a href="https://github.com/nerdzeu/nerdzcrush">on
        GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Or best of all, do you want to contribute some code to NERDZCrush? That's great, because we love to have extra
        contributions. There are guidelines for contributors
        <a href="https://github.com/nerdzeu/nerdzcrush/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">on GitHub</a> and we're looking forward
        to seeing what you can come up with. We've got <a href="https://github.com/nerdzeu/nerdzcrush/issues">a long backlog</a>
        and your help would be great.</p>
