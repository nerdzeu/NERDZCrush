<h1>Ads on NERDZCrush</h1>
<p>This page complements our overall <a href="/serious">privacy policy and terms of use</a>.</p>
<p>NERDZCrush has optional advertising to help cover our costs. There are a few important things you might want to know about.</p>
<ul>
    {% if ads %}
    <li>You can <a href="#" class="ad-opt-out">opt-out</a> &mdash; you are currently <strong><span class="ad-state">opted in</span></strong></li>
    {% else %}
    {% if g.do_not_track %}
    <li>You are <strong>opted-out</strong> and you cannot opt back in because you have Do Not Track set</li>
    {% else %}
    <li>You can <a href="#" class="ad-opt-out">opt-in</a> &mdash; you are currently <strong><span class="ad-state">opted out</span></strong></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
</ul>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com">Project Wonderful</a> for advertising. It took us a long time to find an
advertiser that met our needs for user privacy and had a general do-good attitude. They have an excellent <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com/privacypolicy.php">privacy policy</a>,
and we're glad to have finally found them. They don't track you and they have a great relationship with open software and creative commons.</p>
<p>All of that being said, we still will not show you ads if you have <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> set. Project Wonderful is a third party, which means that
we cannot entirely control how they may or may not track you. If you do not use Do Not Track and you are concerned about this, you
are advised to opt-out of advertising.</p>
<p>We also don't show ads on mobile because that would just suck.</p>
<h2>How do I advertise on NERDZCrush?</h2>
<p>You can bid on ads with <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id={{ ad_id }}&type=5&_r=">Project Wonderful</a>. If you're an open-source project or you feel like you're particularly
in-line with the NERDZCrush way, <a href="mailto:media@nerdz.eu">drop us a line</a> and tell us about yourself. We'll consider
showing some ads for you for free.</p>
<h2>I hate ads but I want to support NERDZCrush!</h2>
<p>No worries! You can <a href="/donate">donate</a> to the cause. You can also just keep on using the site with ads disabled - we won't be upset.</p>
<h2>I run my own NERDZCrush instance, how do I advertise?</h2>
<p>To those who don't understand this question: NERDZCrush is <a href="https://github.com/nerdzeu/MediaCrush">open-source</a>. This means that
any sysadmin with sufficient skill can host their own version of NERDZCrush, or contribute features to ours. If you do so, and you'd like to enable
advertising, please submit an application to Project Wonderful, then fill out the relevant details in <code>config.ini</code>. Ask about any
problems you run into on the mailing list.</p>
